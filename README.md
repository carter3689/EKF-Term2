## Extended Kalman Filter

### Build Instructions

** Start by: **

* Cloning the project `git clone...`
* [Install uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets)
* On a Windows Machine? [Follow these instructions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

**Then...**
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

### Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
  

### C++ Coding Style
The code written in this project (most notably the functions created in `FusionEKF.cpp`, `tools.cpp` and `kalman_filter.cpp`) is following the [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as best as possible.
